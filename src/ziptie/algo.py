class Ziptie:
    """
    An incremental unsupervised clustering algorithm.

    Input channels are clustered together into mutually co-active sets.
    A helpful metaphor is bundling cables together with zip ties.
    Cables that carry related signals are commonly co-active,
    and are grouped together. Cables that are co-active with existing
    bundles can be added to those bundles. A single cable may be ziptied
    into several different bundles. Co-activity is estimated
    incrementally, that is, the algorithm updates the estimate after
    each new set of signals is received.

    When stacked with other levels,
    zipties form a deep sparse network.
    This network has the extremely desirable characteristic of
    l-0 sparsity--the number of non-zero weights is minimized.
    The vast majority of weights in this network are zero,
    and the rest are one.
    This makes sparse computation feasible and allows for
    straightforward interpretation and visualization of the
    features.
